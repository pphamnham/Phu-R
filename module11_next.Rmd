# The R way


As we've seen R is powerful, flexible, and wide-ranging. 

It's also sprawling, disorganized, and use-at-your-own risk. 

Base packages, widely-used packages and packages by frequent R contributors are more trustworthy. 

# Some of the 'features' of R

* R is inconsistent in its naming conventions: Some functions are *camelCase*; others are *dot.separated*; others *use_underscores*. For programmers used to OOP, the use of dots is maddening.
* Multiple OOP paradigms and OOP is not as clean or full-featured as other languages
* R has multiple graphics packages that different functions use for default plot construction (`base`, `grid`, `lattice`, and `ggplot2`)
* R has multiple packages and functions to do the same analysis
* R obscures some of what happens behind the scenes in a way that can be confusing and lead to errors: type coercion/casting, recycling, etc.

Any other things that you found frustrating and don't think are well-designed?


# R tutorials, materials, and assistance

Some of this material was borrowed/modified from [Jared Knowles' bootcamp](http://jaredknowles.com/r-bootcamp/)

CRAN has [manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/manuals.html) and [contributed learning material](https://cran.r-project.org/other-docs.html).

The SCF has a series of [hands-on tutorials](http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/training/tutorials) on related topics, some focused on topics in R, others on topics in UNIX/bash, and others on topics in managing workflows and reproducible research.

[D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu) holds workshops on R and other topics, as well as having drop-in office hours. 

For grad students and researchers in statistics, economics and biostatistics, Chris Paciorek provides consulting via consult@stat.berkeley.edu and consult@econ.berkeley.edu and drop-in discussions in Evans 495.

For researchers around campus, Berkeley Research Computing offers consulting via brc@berkeley.edu on accessing and using cluster and cloud resources on campus and beyond, including R.

Various online tutorials/courses are offered by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/), [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/rprog), and [Leada](https://www.teamleada.com/courses).  The DataCamp Introduction to R and Intermediate R courses are free and look pretty good to me.

# Some good books
